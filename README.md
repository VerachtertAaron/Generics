# Generics

This project contains two exercises on Java Generics.

1. The first exercise is on `UnionUtil`. In `UnionUtilTest`, you find a few non-compiling tests.
Iteratively make all test compile and succeed.
2. The second exercise is on `SwapUtil`. The method for swapping elements in an array does not use generics, please change the method so it uses generics and returns an array of the same type as provided.
