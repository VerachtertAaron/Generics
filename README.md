# Generics

This project contains two exercises on Java Generics.

1. The first exercise is on `UnionUtil`. In `UnionUtilTest`, you find a few non-compiling tests.
Iteratively make all test compile and succeed.
2. The second exercise is on `SwapUtil`.
    1. The method for swapping elements in an array does not use generics, please change the method so it uses generics and returns an array of the same type as provided.
    2. As an extra, generalise the method so it can return an array of any type from which the original type of the array extends. Think about what you have to provide to make this happen.
    3. Now repeat (i) and (ii) using Lists instead of arrays.
